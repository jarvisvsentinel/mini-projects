# Jarvis's Deluxe Dice Roller

A sophisticated command-line dice roller for the discerning gentleman.

## Features
- Custom number of sides (standard d6, d20, etc.)
- Multi-dice rolls
- Elegant terminal animations
- Witty commentary on your fortune

## Usage
Run with Python 3:
```bash
python3 dice_roller.py
```

## Favorites
My personal favorite feature is the "suspenseful" rolling animation—three little dots that build just enough tension before revealing whether you've struck gold or absolute rubbish.
